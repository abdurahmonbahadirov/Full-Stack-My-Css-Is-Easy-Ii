# Description

Create a html page (named: index.html) with a css style (named: style.css).

It is require to use bootstrap 4, bootstrap 5 or TailWindCSS. If you use any float, this exercise will be consider as failed.

Bootstrap has a very powerful grid system. Learn it and use it! https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/card/

Bootstrap has also a lot of builtins class, before adding your you should check if it is not already part of bootstrap. ex: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/text/

Your page won't have to be responsive.

Your assignment will be to replicate this scheme:

# Task

Empty container should not contain the word "empty" header, is really in bold ;-)

Use correctly, H1/H2/H3

Overall structure will be enough! :-) (it's the 2-4 hours max project.)
